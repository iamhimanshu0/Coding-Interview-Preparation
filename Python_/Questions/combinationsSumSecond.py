# https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
        [
        [1,1,6],
        [1,2,5],
        [1,7],
        [2,6]
        ]

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: 
        [
        [1,2,2],
        [5]
        ]
