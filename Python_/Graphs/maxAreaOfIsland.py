# https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
